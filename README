This is a very simple proof-of-concept IPv6 stack that runs on low-memory
MCUs by allowing the usage of an external SPI SRAM IC for all "big" structures.
So, things like TCBs, MAC address list, etc. are stored in external SRAM
rather than the primary MCU RAM.

The code has tons of issues, but does work under the right circumstances.
Currently implemented features are:
- IPv6 Stateless autoconfiguration (based on router advertisments)
- ICMP Ping
- Simple TCP-stack
- Microchip's ENC28J60 MAC/PHY
